# Hello! 👋 
I'm a beginner developer, learning by creating projects in `C++`, `Java`, and `Kotlin`.
# Check out my following projects:
# C➕➕
  - 🪐 Simulation of planetary motion, my first serious encounter with graphics. [🔗](https://github.com/quqveik1/bagbean)
  - 📊 A project where I compare the efficiency of various sorting algorithms. [🔗](https://github.com/quqveik1/ALGORITHMICPROJECT)
  - 🎨 Graphics application, similar to Photoshop. My first significant graphical application. [🔗](https://github.com/quqveik1/GRAPHICAPP)
  - ⚙️ My **graphics engine**, on which some of my other projects are based. [🔗](https://github.com/quqveik1/TESTWIN32_GRAPHICAPP)
  - 📈 An application on **my engine**, where I adjust coefficients to function by values, learning gradient descent and backpropagation of error (very important topics in the era of neural networks). [🔗](https://github.com/quqveik1/GradientDescent)
  - 📉 An application on **my engine**, where I studied splines. [🔗](https://github.com/quqveik1/Splines)
  - ➗ Quadratic equations solver on **my graphics engine**, with documentation. [🔗](https://github.com/quqveik1/QuadraticCalc)
  - 🧮 Initially a string handling project in `C++`, later added comparison of sorting algorithms on my engine. [🔗](https://github.com/quqveik1/StringSort)
  - 🖥️ A program that emulates a processor. I wrote my own assembler (similar to x86), its compiler, and the actual executor - the processor. Video memory is emulated using `SFML`. [🔗](https://github.com/quqveik1/MyVirtualMachine)

# (Java☕|| Kotlin 👩🏻‍💻) && Android📱
- 🌀 Graduation project (took [2nd](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1eez5THT2BT6T6tTuzamW4sCRwRmVm0Jg/view?usp=sharing) place in a regional competition) for Android in `Java` at Samsung Innovation Campus. It's a maze game, featuring procedural level generation using the `A*` algorithm. [🔗](https://github.com/quqveik1/Labyrinth)
- ♟️ Chess game, implemented `min-max` algorithm for gameplay. My first project in `Kotlin`. [🔗](https://github.com/quqveik1/ChessGPT)
- ❓ Quiz game, full-fledged client-server interaction. The server is implemented in `Spring`. Questions are generated using `Chat GPT API`. [🔗](https://github.com/quqveik1/QuizApp)
